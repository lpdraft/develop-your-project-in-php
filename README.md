# PHP Final Project

Put into practice all the previous knowledge learned in the master to develop a project using PHP in the backend layer.

## General analysis

We have created a PHP project with user login and CRUD operations implementing MVC, OOP and MySQL.


### Features

- HTML, CSS and JS on the frontend layer
- PHP on the backend layer
- Create database in MySQL
- And finally, implement MVC pattern using OOP

## Our project requirements were divided into the following bulletpoints
#### 1. You must implement a login page
- User sessions must be managed by PHP
- In the event that the user is already logged in and tries to go to the login URL again, this will redirect him to the main page of your application

#### 2. You must follow same specifications as latest pill:
- (M) 2 models with 3 different functions that obtain information from a database from at least 2 tables
- (V) At least one of the views will have to be reused for more than one action
- (C) You must create a main controller / entry point ( index.php ) that is responsible for receiving the request from the main page.
- You must create one file for each controller and one function for each action. Each action will receive the request as a parameter.

#### 3. There must be at least 4 different actions
-  Demonstrate that the pattern is implemented correctly and are capable of displaying the data obtained from the source in a view.

#### 4. URLâ€™s must be controlled by parameters passed by GET method
